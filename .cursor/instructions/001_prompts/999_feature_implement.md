@05_discipline_management_execution_plan.md I want you to read this execution plan and use sequential thinking to organise your thoughts on how you will follow it to implement it's iterations in order to achieve this user story @05_discipline_management.md . Create a todo list that covers all actions required to complete the next iteration in the plan.

Please ensure that you regularly check back on the plan and follow the instruction flow exactly. This is important so we don't miss things like e2e test, updating the progress of the plan etc.
