## üîç **PATTERN DISCOVERY & CONSISTENCY ANALYSIS**

### **‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY PRE-IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS**

**Rule**: NO development may begin until this analysis is completed and documented with evidence.

### **üîé DISCOVER SIMILAR EXISTING FEATURES**

Based on codebase analysis, the **Age Group Management** feature serves as the primary reference implementation:

```powershell
# Similar feature implementation found
Get-ChildItem -Path "src/components/age-group" -Recurse | Select-Object Name,Directory
# Result: AgeGroupList.tsx, AgeGroupModal.tsx, index.ts

# Existing API pattern
Get-ChildItem -Path "src/app/api/age-groups" -Recurse | Select-Object Name,Directory
# Result: route.ts, [id]/route.ts, __tests__/

# Table component usage pattern
Select-String -Path "src/components/age-group/AgeGroupList.tsx" -Pattern "Table" | Select-Object LineNumber,Line
# Evidence: Uses @/components/ui/table with TableHeader, TableBody, TableCell, TableRow
```

### **üìã PATTERN ANALYSIS CHECKLIST**

**Similar Feature Identification:**

- [x] **Feature Identified**: Age Group Management
  - Location: `src/components/age-group/`, `src/app/api/age-groups/`
  - Implementation approach: List + Modal pattern with CRUD operations
  - Component architecture used: Table component with edit/delete actions, Modal for create/edit

**UI/UX Pattern Analysis:**

- [x] **Modal vs Page Navigation**: Age Groups use **Modal pattern** for create/edit operations
  - Evidence: `AgeGroupModal.tsx` component with modal-based workflow
- [x] **Button Styles**: Uses `@/components/ui/button/Button` with outline variant for actions
  - Evidence: Edit and Delete buttons with `variant="outline"` and appropriate icons
- [x] **Form Patterns**: Modal-based forms with proper validation and loading states
  - Evidence: AgeGroupModal handles form state, validation, and submission
- [x] **Table/List Display**: Uses `@/components/ui/table` components for data display
  - Evidence: AgeGroupList.tsx uses Table, TableHeader, TableBody, TableCell, TableRow
- [x] **Search Functionality**: No search in age groups (simple list), but athletes have search patterns
  - Evidence: AthleteCombobox.tsx shows search/filter patterns for reference

**Component Reuse Analysis:**

- [x] **Existing Components**: Must use established component library with modern table upgrades
  - Component: Table | Location: `@/components/ui/table` ‚Üí **New**: shadcn/ui + TanStack Table for discipline management
  - Component: Button | Location: `@/components/ui/button/Button`
  - Component: Modal | Location: `@/components/ui/modal`
- [x] **Styling Systems**: Tailwind CSS with dark mode support and consistent theming
  - Evidence: Classes like `dark:border-white/[0.05]`, `dark:bg-white/[0.03]`
- [x] **Layout Containers**: Uses ComponentCard and standard layout patterns
  - Evidence: Wrapped in card containers with proper padding and spacing

**Testing Pattern Analysis:**

- [x] **Test File Structure**: Tests in `__tests__/` directories alongside source files
  - Pattern: `src/components/age-group/__tests__/`, `src/app/api/age-groups/__tests__/`
- [x] **Mocking Patterns**: Vitest mocking with React Testing Library for component tests
  - Evidence: Existing test files use `vi.mock()` and `@testing-library/react`
- [x] **Test Utilities**: Shared test utilities in `src/test/` directory
  - Location: `src/test/setup.tsx`, `src/test/test-utils.tsx`

### **üéØ IMPLEMENTATION CONSTRAINTS DERIVED**

Based on pattern analysis, document MANDATORY implementation constraints:

**Architecture Constraints:**

- [x] **Component Structure**: Must follow Modal + List pattern as seen in Age Group Management
- [x] **Navigation Pattern**: Must use Modal approach for create/edit operations like Age Groups
- [x] **State Management**: Must use React state with refresh callbacks like AgeGroupList pattern

**UI/UX Constraints:**

- [x] **Component Usage**: MUST use Button, Modal components + NEW shadcn/ui + TanStack Table for advanced features
- [x] **Styling Approach**: MUST follow Tailwind patterns with dark mode support
- [x] **Layout Structure**: MUST use ComponentCard wrapper and consistent spacing
- [x] **Table Implementation**: MUST use gradual migration approach - shadcn/ui for new features, legacy table for existing components

**Testing Constraints:**

- [x] **Test Structure**: MUST follow `__tests__/` pattern from Age Group implementation
- [x] **Mock Patterns**: MUST use Vitest mocking approach consistent with existing tests
- [x] **Test Organization**: MUST place tests alongside source files in `__tests__` directories

### **‚úÖ PATTERN COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION**

**PRE-DEVELOPMENT SIGN-OFF** (Required before ANY iteration begins):

- [x] **Similar feature analyzed** with Age Group Management as reference implementation
- [x] **UI/UX patterns identified** with Modal + Table pattern and component constraints documented
- [x] **Component reuse opportunities** mapped with existing Button, Modal components + NEW shadcn/ui tables
- [x] **Testing patterns analyzed** with `__tests__/` structure and Vitest approach defined
- [x] **Implementation constraints** clearly defined with evidence from Age Group feature
- [x] **Development approach** designed to integrate seamlessly with existing patterns

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL TABLE COMPONENT CHANGE**:

- **FIRST**: Verify pattern compliance - following established UI patterns with season integration
- **NOTE**: Table components will use NEW shadcn/ui + TanStack Table (different API than existing table components)
- **APPROACH**: Gradual migration - new features use modern tables, existing features remain unchanged until Iteration 6

**‚úÖ APPROVED**: Development may proceed to iterations with clear pattern compliance strategy.

# üöÄ **ITERATION 1: SEASON & DISCIPLINE DATA MODELS**

**Status**: [ ] Not Started | [ ] In Progress | [ ] Completed

## **ITERATION OVERVIEW**

Implement Season and Discipline Prisma models with proper relationships, business rules, and database constraints to provide the foundation for athletics event organization.

**Duration Estimate**: 2-3 hours in single session
**Dependencies**: None
**Scope**: Database schema extension with models, relationships, and migrations

## **üîÑ STRICT ITERATION WORKFLOW**

### **Step 1: Branch & Pull Latest**

```powershell
# Always start with fresh main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feat/iteration1-season-discipline-models
```

### **Step 2: Develop (Initial)**

- **FIRST**: Verify pattern compliance - extending Prisma schema following existing model patterns

npm run test:run       # Quick unit test execution (existing tests only)
npx prisma validate    # Validate Prisma schema
npx prisma generate    # Generate Prisma client
```

### **Step 4: Develop (Refine)**

- Fix any Prisma validation issues from Level 1 testing
- Add proper indexes for query optimization
- **Write comprehensive unit tests** for business rule validation logic and model constraints
- Add season data to `prisma/seed-data.yaml` (Track & Field, Indoors, Cross Country)
- Update `prisma/seed.js` to read season data from YAML file
- Test Prisma client generation and TypeScript types

**Testing Focus**: Test business logic, validation functions, and constraint enforcement - NOT Prisma ORM functionality

npm run test:all                # Complete unit + E2E tests
npm run validate:pre-docker     # Full validation pipeline
npx prisma migrate dev          # Create and apply migration
```

### **Step 6.5: Docker Deployment Validation**

```powershell
# Deploy to Docker and validate database schema
docker-compose up --build -d
docker-compose ps              # Verify all containers are running
docker-compose logs web --tail=50  # Check for deployment errors

# Validate schema in containerized environment

## **ITERATION OVERVIEW**

Implement Season management user interface following established age group patterns to provide season administration functionality.

**Duration Estimate**: 2-3 hours in single session
**Dependencies**: Iterations 1 (Season model), 2 (Season API)
**Scope**: Season list, create, edit, delete UI components with modal-based workflow

## **üîÑ STRICT ITERATION WORKFLOW**

### **Step 2: Develop (Initial)**

- **FIRST**: Verify pattern compliance - following established UI patterns with season integration
- **NOTE**: Table components will use NEW shadcn/ui + TanStack Table (different API than existing table components)
- **Pattern Compliance Check**: Confirm component structure matches Modal + List pattern with modern table implementation

- **Install shadcn/ui table components** for advanced table functionality
- Implement SeasonList component with shadcn/ui + TanStack Table (with sorting, filtering)
- Implement SeasonModal component following AgeGroupModal pattern
- Create season management page following established page structure
- **DO NOT write tests yet** - focus on UI implementation first
- **DO NOT modify API endpoints** - pure UI focus

### **Step 4: Develop (Refine)**

- Fix any styling or component integration issues
- Ensure dark mode compatibility and responsive design
- **Write comprehensive component tests** following existing patterns
- Add user interaction tests for CRUD operations
- Test modal workflows and form validation
- **Write Playwright E2E tests** following `@playwright-testing-standards.mdc` one test at a time

## **üìã ITERATION 4 IMPLEMENTATION**

**Rule Reference**: `nextjs-structure-standards.mdc`, `ui-tailwind-css-standards.mdc`

**Files to Create/Modify**:

- `src/components/season/SeasonList.tsx` (new - season list component)
- `src/components/season/SeasonModal.tsx` (new - season create/edit modal)
- `src/components/season/index.ts` (new - component exports)
- `src/components/season/__tests__/` (new - component tests)
- `src/app/(admin)/seasons/page.tsx` (new - season management page)

**Implementation Steps**:

1. **Install shadcn/ui table components**: `npx shadcn-ui@latest add table` and `npm install @tanstack/react-table`
2. Create SeasonList component using NEW shadcn/ui + TanStack Table with sorting and filtering capabilities
3. Create SeasonModal component for create/edit operations following AgeGroupModal patterns
4. Implement season management page with proper authentication and layout
5. Add component tests following existing test patterns (testing business logic, not TanStack functionality)
6. **Create Playwright E2E tests** following `@playwright-testing-standards.mdc` incremental development approach
7. Ensure proper styling and dark mode support with shadcn/ui components

### **Playwright E2E Testing (Following @playwright-testing-standards.mdc)**

**CRITICAL**: Follow "One Test at a Time" development process to avoid past Playwright delays

#### **Page Object Models**

Create dedicated page objects for season management workflow:

```typescript
// tests/pages/SeasonPage.ts
import { Page, expect } from '@playwright/test';

export class SeasonPage {
  constructor(private page: Page) {}

  async goto() {
    await this.page.goto('/seasons');
    await expect(this.page).toHaveURL(/seasons/);
  }

  async createSeason(name: string, description: string) {
    // Use semantic locators - NO CSS selectors
    await this.page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Add Season' }).click();
    await this.page.getByLabel('Season Name').fill(name);
    await this.page.getByLabel('Description').fill(description);
    await this.page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Create Season' }).click();

    // Proper waiting - NO arbitrary timeouts
    await expect(this.page.getByText(name)).toBeVisible();
  }

  async editSeason(oldName: string, newName: string) {
    await this.page
      .getByRole('row', { name: oldName })
      .getByRole('button', { name: 'Edit' })
      .click();
    await this.page.getByLabel('Season Name').clear();
    await this.page.getByLabel('Season Name').fill(newName);
    await this.page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Update Season' }).click();

    await expect(this.page.getByText(newName)).toBeVisible();
  }

  async deleteSeason(seasonName: string) {
    await this.page
      .getByRole('row', { name: seasonName })
      .getByRole('button', { name: 'Delete' })
      .click();
    await this.page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Confirm Delete' }).click();

    await expect(this.page.getByText(seasonName)).not.toBeVisible();
  }
}
```

#### **Test Implementation (Incremental Approach)**

**Step 1**: Write ONE test skeleton

```typescript
// tests/specs/season-management.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import { AppWorkflow } from '../pages/AppWorkflow';
import { SeasonPage } from '../pages/SeasonPage';

test('user can manage seasons', async ({ page }) => {
  // TODO: Will implement step by step
});
```

**Step 2**: Add navigation and verify, then debug

```powershell
npx playwright test --grep "user can manage seasons" --debug
```

**Step 3**: Add ONE more action, then debug again

```typescript
test('user can manage seasons', async ({ page }) => {
  const app = new AppWorkflow(page);
  const seasonPage = new SeasonPage(page);

  await app.signInWithClub('admin@example.com', 'password123', 'Test Club');
  await seasonPage.goto();

  // STOP HERE - debug this step before adding more
});
```

**Step 4**: Continue incrementally, debugging each addition

```powershell
# Debug each step individually - NEVER skip this
npx playwright test --grep "user can manage seasons" --debug
```

#### **Required E2E Test Coverage**

- [ ] **Season list display** with shadcn/ui table sorting and filtering
- [ ] **Create season modal** workflow with form validation
- [ ] **Edit season modal** workflow with form updates
- [ ] **Delete season** workflow with confirmation dialog
- [ ] **Season table sorting** by name and creation date
- [ ] **Season table filtering** and search functionality

#### **Debugging Commands (Windows PowerShell)**

```powershell
# Start with one test in debug mode
npx playwright test --grep "specific test name" --debug

# Use UI mode for visual development
npx playwright test --ui

# Generate selectors with Codegen
npx playwright codegen localhost:3000/seasons
```

#### **Smart Waiting - NO Arbitrary Timeouts**

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Proper waiting for shadcn/ui table updates
await expect(page.getByText('Loading...')).not.toBeVisible();
await expect(page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Create Season' })).toBeEnabled();

// ‚úÖ Wait for API responses
await page.waitForResponse(
  response =>
    response.url().includes('/api/seasons') && response.status() === 200
);
```

#### **Business Rule Testing (Critical)**

```typescript
// Test timed vs measured validation
test('validates timed vs measured discipline types', async ({ page }) => {
  const disciplinePage = new DisciplinePage(page);

  // Test timed discipline creation
  await disciplinePage.createDiscipline(
    '100m Sprint',

# üöÄ **ITERATION 6: TABLE COMPONENT MIGRATION**

**Status**: [ ] Not Started | [ ] In Progress | [ ] Completed

## **ITERATION OVERVIEW**

Migrate existing table components (AthleteList, AgeGroupList, BasicTableOne, RecentOrders) to use shadcn/ui + TanStack Table for consistency and enhanced functionality across the application.

**Duration Estimate**: 4-6 hours (can be split across multiple sessions)
**Dependencies**: Iterations 1-5 (all discipline management features completed)
**Scope**: Upgrade 4 existing components to use modern table implementation with sorting, filtering, and improved UX

## **üîÑ STRICT ITERATION WORKFLOW**

### **Step 2: Develop (Initial)**

- **FIRST**: Verify pattern compliance - using established shadcn/ui + TanStack Table patterns from Iterations 4-5
- **Migration Strategy**: Component-by-component migration to minimize risk
- **Priority Order**: AthleteList ‚Üí AgeGroupList ‚Üí BasicTableOne ‚Üí RecentOrders
- **Pattern Compliance Check**: Ensure each migrated component follows shadcn/ui table patterns
- **Architecture Verification**: Maintain existing functionality while adding sorting/filtering capabilities
- Migrate AthleteList to shadcn/ui + TanStack Table (sorting by name, date; filtering by search)
- Migrate AgeGroupList to shadcn/ui + TanStack Table (sorting by name, ordinal; simple functionality)
- **DO NOT write tests yet** - focus on migration implementation first
- **DO NOT modify API endpoints** - pure UI component migration

### **Step 4: Develop (Refine)**

- Complete migration of BasicTableOne and RecentOrders components
- Add enhanced functionality (sorting, filtering) where appropriate
- **Write comprehensive component tests** for migrated components
- **Test migration compatibility** - ensure no regression in existing workflows
- **Test enhanced features** - verify sorting and filtering work correctly

## **üìã ITERATION 6 IMPLEMENTATION**

**Rule Reference**: `nextjs-structure-standards.mdc`, `ui-tailwind-css-standards.mdc`, `bp-testing-standards.mdc`

**Files to Modify**:

- `src/components/athlete/AthleteList.tsx` (migrate to shadcn/ui + TanStack Table)

- `src/components/ecommerce/RecentOrders.tsx` (migrate to shadcn/ui + TanStack Table)
- `src/components/athlete/__tests__/AthleteList.test.tsx` (update tests)
- `src/components/age-group/__tests__/AgeGroupList.test.tsx` (update tests)

**Files to Remove**:

- `src/components/ui/table/index.tsx` (replace with shadcn/ui table components)

**Implementation Steps**:

1. **Component Migration Priority**: AthleteList (most complex) ‚Üí AgeGroupList (simpler) ‚Üí Demo components
2. **AthleteList Migration**:
   - Replace table imports with shadcn/ui components
   - Add TanStack Table with sorting (name, date) and search functionality

   - Test athlete workflow thoroughly
3. **AgeGroupList Migration**:
   - Replace table imports with shadcn/ui components
   - Add TanStack Table with sorting (name, ordinal)
   - Maintain existing edit/delete functionality
   - Test age group management workflow
4. **Demo Component Migration**:
   - Migrate BasicTableOne and RecentOrders to shadcn/ui patterns
   - Add basic sorting functionality for demonstration
5. **Legacy Cleanup**: Remove old `src/components/ui/table/index.tsx` after all migrations complete
6. **Testing**: Update component tests to reflect new table API and test enhanced functionality

## üìö **APPENDIX: SESSION MANAGEMENT**

### **Starting a New Session**

1. **Context Recovery**: Read progress dashboard and identify current iteration
2. **Git Status Check**: Verify branch and working directory status
3. **Status Check**: Update iteration checkboxes based on actual completion
4. **Environment Verification**: Run `npm run quality:check` for quick validation
5. **Database Status**: Check Prisma schema and migration status with `npx prisma db status`

### **Iteration Workflow (Per Session)**

1. **Branch & Pull** ‚Üí Start fresh from main: `git checkout main && git pull origin main`
2. **Create Branch** ‚Üí `git checkout -b feat/iterationX-feature-name`
3. **Develop** ‚Üí Implement initial feature functionality following established patterns
4. **Test L1** ‚Üí `npm run quality:check && npm run test:run`
5. **Develop** ‚Üí Refine based on immediate feedback and write comprehensive tests
6. **Test L2** ‚Üí `npm run test:coverage && npm run build`
7. **Test L3** ‚Üí `npm run test:all && npm run validate:pre-docker`
8. **Docker Validation** ‚Üí `docker-compose up --build -d` + feature validation
9. **Update Progress** ‚Üí Update execution plan and commit progress tracking changes
10. **Create PR** ‚Üí Push branch and create detailed pull request

### **Quality Gates (4-Level Testing Pyramid)**

- **Level 1**: Immediate feedback (quality:check, test:run, prisma validate)
- **Level 2**: Integration validation (test:coverage, build, database operations)
- **Level 3**: Release readiness (test:all, validate:pre-docker)
- **Level 4**: Docker deployment validation (containerized environment testing)

### **Emergency Recovery**

If issues occur during an iteration:

1. Check git status: `git status && git log --oneline -5`
2. Review test failures: Check npm script output logs
3. Run regression check: `npm run test:all` to verify no breaking changes
4. Check Prisma status: `npx prisma db status` for database issues
5. Consult specific rule documentation for guidance
6. Rollback to iteration start if needed: `git checkout main && git branch -D current-branch`

### **Session Continuity Rules**

- Each iteration should complete in a single session (2-4 hours)
- If incomplete, document exact stopping point in progress dashboard
- Always end sessions with a clean git state (committed or stashed)
- Next session starts with fresh main pull and context recovery
- Prisma schema changes require proper migration handling across sessions
